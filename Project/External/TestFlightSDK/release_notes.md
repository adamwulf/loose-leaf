## 1.3

### 1.3.0-beta.6

Fix bug with crash reporting in iOS 7

### 1.3.0-beta.5

Improvements

- Size of SDK reduced by 50%
- New In App Update UI in an alert with landscape support. Should work for all different types of apps.
- Manual Sessions: You can manually control session start and end. See `TestFlight+ManualSessions.h` for more information
- Combining of back to back sessions. If a session starts less than 30 seconds from the last session which ended, the previous session is continued. You may change the time limit (or turn this off) using the `TFOptionSessionKeepAliveTimeout` option key.
- `TFOptionReportCrashes` option to not install crash handlers

Bugs Fixed

- Fixed possible `-[TFAirTrafficController getNumberOrNilFrom:withKey:]` crash when bad data is received.

### 1.3.0-beta.4

- Removed all access to mac address
- Added AdSupport.framework requirement
    - AdSupport.framework is automatically loaded on iOS 6.0+ if not weak linked with app
    
### 1.3.0-beta.3

Improvements

- Add format attribute to TFLog to show warnings for wrong format specifiers or not using a format string

Bugs Fixed

- TF Permissions were not always respected
- Persist session information in case of uncatchable crash (so we can properly end the session on next startup)
- Fix some msgpack bugs

### 1.3.0-beta.2

- Pause all network traffic if server is not reachable

Bugs Fixed

- CoreTelephony crash work around: this is a workaround of a iOS bug that causes deallocated instances of `CTTelephonyNetworkInfo` to receive notifications which causes crashes. Core Telephony is used to retrieve the device's mobile carrier.
- Fixed addrinfo memory leak

### 1.3.0-beta.1

Improvements

- ARC
- All public TestFlight methods may be called from any thread or dispatch_queue
- All public TestFlight methods (except for TFLog) are asynchronous, so there is never a wait on them
- TestFlight never uses more than 1 network connection at a time
- All network traffic is grouped together, sent at once, and transferred in MessagePack. This results in using less bandwidth and less network calls.

Removed

- Removed Questions
- Removed Feedback View (along with backtrace option)

- Fixed bug where logs not sent on crash
- Fixed bug where empty crash files were created (but not sent)
