extern NSString *const TFOptionFlushSecondsInterval; // Defaults to @60. Set to a number. @0 turns off the flush timer. 30 seconds is the minimum flush interval.
extern NSString *const TFOptionLogOnCheckpoint; // Defaults to @YES. Because logging is synchronous, if you have a high preformance app, you might want to turn this off.
extern NSString *const TFOptionLogToConsole; // Defaults to @YES. Prints remote logs to Apple System Log.
extern NSString *const TFOptionLogToSTDERR; // Defaults to @YES. Sends remote logs to STDERR when debugger is attached.

extern NSString *const TFOptionReportCrashes; // Defaults to @YES. If set to @NO, crash handlers are never installed. Must be set **before** calling `takeOff:`.
extern NSString *const TFOptionSendLogOnlyOnCrash; // Defaults to @NO. Setting to @YES stops remote logs from being sent when sessions end. They would only be sent in the event of a crash.

If they are away from the app for longer, a new session is created when they come back. Must be a number. Change to @0 to turn off.
